# Intermittent Tailwind Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes fail to apply consistently after the build process. The issue is intermittent and doesn't produce any clear console errors, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

Classes defined in the Tailwind configuration are not applied to certain components after the build process. This behavior occurs randomly and isn't tied to a specific pattern of class usage or component structure.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the build process (instructions will vary based on your setup).
3. Observe that some components are missing the expected Tailwind styling.
4. Rebuild the project.  Sometimes the issue resolves itself, other times it persists.

## Solution

The provided `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution. This involves thoroughly cleaning the build directory to ensure old or corrupted files aren't interfering with the build process.
